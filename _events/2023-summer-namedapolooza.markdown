When this occurs, the action will add a Reviewer to the PR so that the issue(s) can be triaged. This will help bridge the gap between AppSec Snyk Admins and Development Team(s). |
| [Jonathan](https://github.com/jonathanatsnyk)<br />[Vishal](https://github.com/vishal-thenge) | ["Super Secret Project"](https://github.com/jonathanatsnyk/namedapolooza-2023-summer-template) | Each quarter we waste a tremendous amount hours filling out dozens of RFPs. The RFP process is tedious, generic, and not the best use of SE or R&D time. This project is an proof of concept to demonstrate how RFPs could be automated via the use of generative AI. By leveraging the power of AI to automate RFPs, we free up SE time to give demos, meet with customers, dig into to new product features and add value in other areas of the business. |

| [Heather](https://github.com/RunningContacts)<br />Anastasia | [Snyk Malicious Package Finder](https://github.com/RunningContacts/SecureSisters) | Malicious package finder used Snyk CLI results to scan for malicious packages. It provides an extra layer of protection and helps ensure that your project is free from potential vulnerabilities. This .yml file will parse through your snyk CLI output file (json) Then review the results for where snyk has identified a Malicious Package.<br />The results can be consumed by a flat file and break the build process. |
